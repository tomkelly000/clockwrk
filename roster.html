Adlai Felser is fast, but this guy obviously spends a lot of time in the gym. He is one of the best athletes on Clockwork. Look at Adlai Felser's dump D! Adlai Felser is probably the only player at this tournament who could have gotten that D. Some days, to write poetry, you need a pencil and a paper; others, you just need cleats and a disc. That guy is so clutch!</p>

                Bio:  Ancient Clockwork legend tells of a strongman named Blake Dyer who leg-pressed mountains with ease and drank the blood of his enemies for sustenance. This Blake Dyer is no longer with us.  He has since been replaced by the Rock Doctor (Rocktor), who prides himself on his hacky sack skills and his ability to identify all birds with just a single glance at their genitalia.<br />This reincarnation of Blake is a dedicated vegan, which can often stand in the way of giving impassioned speeches to the team.  His last attempt at inspiration was sidetracked when, after describing how the team must "steal the other team's carrot" Blake began to graphically describe how he would eat the carrot, got a boner, and blacked out. His veganism additionally occupies much of his time, as he is constantly making up cool-sounding words such as "tempeh" and "seitan" to make himself feel better about the shit he eats.
                <br />On occasion, Blake is mistaken for Tyrion Lannister, presumably because of his affinity for wordplay, and definitely having nothing to do with his height. One of his peculiarities is his affinity for the number 7, which is believed to be the age at which he stopped growing. If you're looking for Blake, you can find him in Guyot Hall, where he can be seen staring intently at rocks and making pointed observations such as "this one is pretty grey."

              <p>
              Bio: Julian Hungero-Kelly is youth. Exuberance. Wantonness. Those that knew him best noticed least when he dyed his hair blond, because to them it had always shone golden with his head's vivacious inner radiance. Always moving a great distance per small unit of time, Julian's legs are formidable and many believe their names (H and K) are the source of his nickname.
              <br />The emotional core of Julian's lightning quick exterior persona is a bear trapped in a twink's body. His lithe form and spun gold hair yield assumptions, labels, and twinky teasing that are counter to Julian's inner identity. Because of this, though, Julian is the only member of Clockwork capable of communicating with the Team Girlfriend, a creature at once simple and difficult to understand, but certainly not exclusive with him.
              <br />A lot of people ask what the dash in Hungero-Kelly stands for and, while I think no really man knows, my best guesses are -ology and -headed. Julian came to frisbee as naturally as frisbee came to Julian as naturally as scrubs go to Sunday brunch. If he isn't smoking fools under, he's smoking them deep; or else he's on defense, and is merely biding his time to smoke. Wink.
              <br />In short, any man who does not vote for HK is a fubsy fool.

                Bio: Tom Kelly is a Colombian novelist, short-story writer, screenwriter and journalist, known affectionately as TK throughout Latin America. Considered one of the most significant authors and ultimate players of the 20th century, he was awarded the 1972 Neustadt International Prize for Literature and the 1982 Nobel Prize in Literature, and is the earliest remaining living recipient. He pursued a self-directed education and physical fitness regimen that resulted in his leaving law school for a career in journalism and a spot on ClockBlock. From early on, he showed no inhibitions in criticizing Colombian and foreign politics, and in laying out to get the D. In 1958, he married Mercedes Barcha, a Lady Clock alumna; they have two sons, Rodrigo and Gonzalo. While his age is often seen as a weakness by his opponents, his teammates realized early on that with his brittle bones come great wisdom and a keen understanding of the game.

                <p>AKA Nooj</p>
                <p>5'8"</p>
                <p>Class of 2013</p>
                <p>Hometown: West Windsor, NJ</p>

                Bio: On January 30, 1991, Jason Steinberg came into the world. He was always kind of an awkward kid, but quite a brilliant one too. The best decision he ever made in his life was to start playing Ultimate when he was a freshman in high school. He had some pretty sweet throws by the time he came to Princeton, and he quietly introduced himself to Clockwork as Jason. Jason Yun '10 was clearly intimidated by this new, better-looking Jason, and he quickly thought of a nickname to preserve his own identity. And just like that, Nooj was born.
                <br />
                Don't be fooled by Nooj's shy demeanor; he is a fearless leader of Clockwork and plays unrelenting defense. You might see him just Noojing around campus at times, with no destination in mind, but on the field, his cuts are sharp and his hucks are deadly. Nooj is also well known for his popularity with the ladies, especially when he has his trusty wingman, Eduardo.
                Recently, Nooj has been used colloquially as a verb, an adjective, and basically any other part of speech you can think of. So I will leave you with one last thought: Nooj noojes noojingly, noojing noojes nooj. Nooj.</p>

                Bio: Krishna Kulkarni was born in the wild woods of Houston, Texas, not by the vagina of a woman as one would typically expect, but instead he passed into life through the vaginal passages of a mother wolf. Raised by wolves through his childhood, it was not until he was introduced into society in his freshman year at Princeton that he discovered at nights he would transform into a beast, half man, half wolf, and rampage around mauling skanks. He visited an old wiseman to learn how he could possibly lift his curse, and the wiseman told him he was cursed to roam the nights as a beast until he had slept with a hundred virgin freshmen. Krishna joined the ultimate team as a way to meet such freshman girls, and discovered his wolfish powers lent themselves to the sport, and ever since that day, he has been skying bitches and preying on freshman girls, working diligently until the day that he can finally lift his curse.

                <p>Class of 2015</p>

                <p>
                Bio: Alex.  It's one of the most common first names in the English language.  Lee.  A ubiquitous surname in English, Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese.  When you're stuck with a name like Alex Lee, it's a wonder your parents even remember you exist.  Poor Alex Lee knew growing up he would have to do something extraordinary to achieve his secret goal of eventually being known as Alexander the Greatest.</p>
                <p>
                On his journey to the present day, young Alex Lee made a number of efforts to distinguish himself and get people to acknowledge his presence.  He attended a high school called the Canandaigua Academy, which sounded good until he realized it was actually a school for Canadians with impaired spelling abilities.  Impressively, he did manage to date a white girl for a time before his parents clamped down and insisted he protect his family's honor.  Left with no choice, Alex Lee buckled down and studied until he was accepted to Princeton University, taking a giant first step towards finally becoming a somebody.
                </p><p>
                He then made the fatal mistake to major in ORFE, and sank back into obscurity as just another engineer who was too smart for econ but still wanted to make money.  He desperately cut his hair Skrillex style in Georgia last year, but it was too late.  Mere inches from the edge of the void of total namelessness, Alex Lee was on his way down when the devil appeared before him and halted his fall.  He gave Alex Lee a choice: Sink into nothingness, or sell his soul to Satan and become a slave to pitchfork.com.  Alex looked out into the inky darkness, thought for a second, and opened up his web browser.
                </p><p>
                Nowadays, Alex enjoys listening to Taylor Swift and other singers nobody else has heard of.  He also plays ultimate for Clockwork in hopes that he will make a name for himself as a dark horse handler and free himself from his pact with the Devil.

                <p>
                Bio: Yuan Chen was an American professional basketball player with the New York Knicks of the National Basketball Association (NBA). After receiving no athletic scholarship offers out of high school and being undrafted out of college, the Harvard University graduate reached a deal later that year with his hometown Golden State Warriors. In February 2012, he unexpectedly led a winning streak by New York, which generated a global following known as Chensanity.
                <br />
                Eventually, Yuan realized how lousy a team the Knicks were and retired from professional basketball. After realizing his economics degree from a second-rate school like Harvard was worthless, Yuan decided to go back to college and came to Princeton. While here, He decided to major in a real subject like Electrical Engineering motivated by the fact that it "triumphs over MAE" and has recently expressed his love for the subject matter by devoting hours of his time to car lab instead of uploading the pictures from developmental regionals.
                <br />
                Since joining Clockwork, Yuan has been known for his "nice cutting technique" as well as his fast break offense.

              <p>
              Bio: Brohao earned his improved nickname by winning the man-versus-keg challenge at his rookie appearance in Georgia (legit) before leading the rookies in an inspiring beach lacrosse victory over Yale (sucks). Since then he has developed tremendously as a defender, as a handler, as a bro, and most of all as a ladies man.  Brohau is well-known for never missing a Clock-Lady Clock mixer and his success on the dance floor, out-competing even Adlai.  Brohau is in the running for the squirrelly Asian handler role left vacant since Adam Hugh, and has even been observed watching Princeton Sciuridae for "tips". His bromance with Patrick has gone a long way to improving relations with the B team, and has cemented the best Clockwork pairing since Pinky and the Brain. His time as president saw the reform of the Clockwork government, with the introduction of a vice president, secretaries, and commander of the praetorian guard.  When not at practice, Brohau spends all his time in Icahn running "experiments" in lab.  He claims his work is actually pretty sciency, but we all think he's just creating a perfect Frisbee player with a combination of his and Michael Jordan's genes.

              Bio: Who is Jarred Mickalicka? Not me. That's for sure. Jarred is an enigmatic figure in Clockwork lore whose essence resists being pinned down. Clad in full Clock uniform, Jarred  is Clockwork's most perfectly beautiful specimen --- with his chiseled cheek bones and Adonic body, he is the team's exemplary Aryan (sorry Neal). But catch him around campus and he's in full-on hipster Clarke Kent mode. Is he Superman (he's certainly not a bird or a plane)? Maybe. Or maybe you think he's more Mandarin because Mandarin is Asian. This would be a misconception – Jarred is not actually Asian. He is more like Iron Man....because he slays Asians.  But I think he's more of a Rorschach. Not especially chatty on the field, but if you mess with him or just try to play offense, he will fuck you up – and he's got the TMFs to prove it. But if you do decide to play against him, be warned: he can't be predicted – he's got a devastating no-look flick. As a good athlete who throws his body around for D's and has made huge progress as an offensive weapon in short period time, Jarred is going to be a pillar of D-line in years to come. So who is Jarred Mihalik? A mystery sure, but maybe also Clockwork's newest hero.

By 3 on 3 season, his knees were on their way out, and by regionals he could only make it through the first few games.  He doesn't always play ultimate, but when he does, he prefers to play really well.  In all seriousness, Matt Rogers is really really sick.  We have decided to quarantine him to a large, and (most importantly) padded bubble so that he can not injure himself until we are ready to unleash him upon the world.

                Bio: I'm Ross Smith, a bankruptcy lawyer in Sandusky, Ohio. I have over thirty years of experience helping people who need a way to get out of debt and back on track. If you need a chance to put your debt behind you and get legal protection from your creditors, I can help. Many people who file bankruptcy do so for one of these four reasons. Do any of these common problems apply to your situation?
                <br />
                Medical bills. Sixty-two percent of consumer bankruptcies are caused by medical bills. Who knew? Expensive doctors plus crappy insurance cause bankruptcy.
                Bill collectors. Gee, if you have 20 collectors calling you 10 times a day, at work, at home and at the neighbors, you'll finally file bankruptcy just to get some peace. Do you think that bill collectors know that they are one of the primary causes of bankruptcy?
                <br />
                Credit card companies. Golly, the bank just jacked your interest rate to 29.99%and lowered your credit limit! Then they slapped you with an over limit fee of $39.00 a month. In the end, the bank is surprised that you can't make the increased minimum payment. And the bank is shocked — shocked! — to get your Notice of Bankruptcy. My condolences to the banks.
                Predator Mortgages. Holy cats! Your home has a $150,000.00 mortgage, but it's only worth $115,000.00. Worse, the interest rate is 9.5% or even higher. We wonder why you can't make that payment… but not much. Time to file a bankruptcy.

                <p>Class of 2014</p>
                <p>Hometown: Baton Rouge, LA</p>
                <p>Club teams: Gunswick</p>
                <p>
                Bio: A highly sought after recruit from the swamps of Louisiana, Stephen Wang
                had ultimate scouts drooling over his potential. Affectionately known as "Every
                Coach's Dream", Wang had a cannon of an arm, pogo sticks for legs, and the entire
                country in anticipation about his impending college decision. On a nationally
                televised special Wang announced that he would be taking his talents to New Jersey
                to unite with hometown hero Andrew Bergman and fellow prized recruit Neal
                Donnelly, netting himself an army of haters at home and the Boys and Girls Club of
                Louisiana about $2 million.<br />
                However the "Wang Dynasty" didn't begin as successfully as expected as
                Wang struggled to carry his teammates and the country's expectations. Additionally,
                disaster struck for Stephen both personally and professionally. A severe case of eye
                herpes plagued him on the morning of a tournament and severely limited his ability,
                inevitably leading to a disaster now known as the "Massacre in Mercer" where
                Clockwork almost managed to lose to its own B-team. However, the worst was yet to
                come, as Clockwork Ultimate was about to experience the biggest sports scandal
                this side of Tiger Woods. First a few isolated rumors from TMZ began filtering in
                and then the bombshell came from a most curious of sources. A mysterious insider,
                who only identified herself as VQu to protect her identity, informed ESPN via Skype
                that the rumors were true: Wang indeed had a tiny penis.<br />
                Wang was devastated. After a brief layoff from college ultimate for personal
                reasons, Wang rededicated himself to the game he loves. From hitting the weight
                room at the crack of dawn to sprinting to the farthest poles he could find, Wang was
                determined to compensate for his now famous deficiency with tremendous on-field
                success, and the results were staggering. His sheer determination almost carried
                Clockwork to a surprise bid to Nationals in his sophomore season.<br />
                It's interesting to think about how Ultivillage historians centuries from now
                will classify Stephen's time at Princeton. The next two years will ultimately
                determine whether the Wang Dynasty was a rousing success in the face of adversity
                or an experiment derailed by scandal. Despite all this uncertainty, however, one
                thing is for sure: nobody will be working harder than Wang.

                <h3>Dean Makino</h3>
                <p>AKA The Dream</p>
                <p>5'11''</p>
                <p>Class of 2015</p>
                <p>Hometown: Weston, MA</p>

                Bio: A man shrouded in mystery, the sheer mention of his name will elicit the response, "who the fuck is Dean?" Make no mistake, once one finally meets Dean Makino, one does not forget Dean Makino. When he's not shitting on the defense with his relentless cutting, he's most likely whispering obscenties into his mark's ear (although it is rumored that Dean, indeed, has a voice "which makes wolverines purr"). Dean has never had second thoughts about any in-game decision, since he always knows the wrong thing to do. Nevertheless, he has been a vital part of ClockBlock, and we hope to see great things down the road from Dean. To quote the words of a much wiser man: "Never have I ever seen an individual play so retarded and yet play so well."
