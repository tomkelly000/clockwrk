                <p>
                Bio: Julian HK had a modest freshman year on Clockwork, playing for the B team and shamefully missing Georgia. However, nobody on the team was prepared for what was to come (see this video - "Dude from Miami plays ultimate - you won't believe what happens next!!"). HK, decked his army out in the red of his beloved Miami Heat and staged a coup d'etat, displacing Rodrigo and then disguising his true role as dictator with the more PC title of "Party Pope". Under his tenure, clockwork ragers started to live up to their name even resulting in some frosh week parties that people couldn't even get in to. Not content with being de facto in charge of Clockwork, HK had to have the title too, and so with the rest of the team held at gunpoint, El Helguero was elected captain for his senior year. HK's captaincy has been treated kindly by history, with some prominent academics noting how he puts 110% into all aspects of his life that have nothing to do with schoolwork. Surpring some, HK is deeply monogamous in his private life, having stayed with the same mate throughout college despite admitting that if he didn't have a girlfriend "I'd be pretty slutty". Off the field, his passions include everything to do with beer (drinking it, drinking it, making it, reviewing it, drinking it, washing his clothes in it, drinking it), careful following of the Heat,dabbling in English football and has been to rehab three times so far to treat his LoL addiction (roommates Jae and Peter are thought to be enablers here). On the field, HK's slight frame and speed allow him to make blazing deep cuts. However, he has never been seen coming under. He also has a staunch moral opposition to playing defence and has been incredibly principled in his refusal to do anything related to it.

              <h3>Alex Fogg</h3>
              <p>Sophomore</p>
              <p>AKA Goopy</p>
              <p>Height: 5'8"</p>
              <p>Hometown: Florida, Florida</p>
              <p>Club teams: Palmdale Recreational Golf Jamboree 2003</p>
              <p>
              Bio: Alex Fogg, affectionately referred to as Goopy, joined the team more recently than most 2016ers.  However, his relative experience level hasn't stopped him from rising through the ranks and securing a firm spot on the A-team.  His throws- great.  His cutting-  also great.  However, Alex serves as a major inspiration for the team both on and off the field.  In a sport that has stymied the success of most victims of Bannayan-Riley-Ruvacalba syndrome, Alex hasn't let his condition get in the way of his athleticism.  Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome is characterized by pigmented maculae of the glans penis, macrocephaly, and benign mesodermal hematomas.  Delayed neuropsychomotor development can also be present.  Many patients also have Hashimoto's goiter lesions, and Alex is no exception.  His sores often weep and bleed in practice, but this doesn't stop him from training hard; nor does the sloughing off of his inner thigh and arm skins when bidding for a disc.  The Clockwork practice field is often littered with scabby "skin-buttons," but after duking it out in a scrimmage, Alex always finds the time collect them all in his characteristic "Lesions-Pail."  He can be seen walking to and from his many chemistry classes happily munching on these collected nuggets, as he read that consuming one's own weepy sores may reverse the cumbersome effects of Bannayan-Riley-Ruvacalba.  Alex also continues to grow as a player, developing faster flicks and longer hucks; he's also developing thick scabby skin-plaques on his palms.  Hardened to the tips of his fingers, these extensions allow Alex to reach higher to rip discs from the grasp of lesser players.  Watch out for this guy on the field, as his post-point celebration routine includes coughing up coagulated blood-balls and tossing them gingerly, as if playing some twisted version of bocce.  He's also been known to lay these platelet-berries down onto the green, grab his trusty 5-wood, and tee off into the unsuspecting backs of defeated adversaries as they walk back to their endzone.  A formidable opponent and great guy, Alex surprisingly gets laid a lot despite his condition.

              <p>Club teams: </p>
              <p>
              Bio: Kiffa, known as "Queefa" by the rest of the team thanks to Stephen Wang, was one of five rookies on the A-team this past season. His superb ability to run fast combined with his special ability to confuse opponents by running around in circles makes him a formidable force as a D-Line cutter. His pastimes include writing Ivy League Papers, entrepreneurship, and staying on top of the current money making markets. His morals may be questionable, but his Ultimate skills possibly make up for it, but we're still not sure about that. On the field, he neutralizes opponents with homemade tranquilizers, and--well let's just say he gets the job done. One thing is for sure, Kiffa will definitely show up to more parties than you can count while staying within "single digit shots" if he has a tournament the next day, so be on the lookout for one of the preseason's top contenders for "most likely to not be sober."

              Bio: A chemistry major starting his junior year, Sean "woodland fairy" Treacy uses his acid tongue to neutralize all the basic bitches he has to deal with. Also known as "blackout" Sean, or just Alpha, Sean somehow ascended to the position of captain. After the election Sean blacked in and laughed hysterically wondering how desperate we really were. A Freshman for life, LadyClock only recently figured out he wasn't a figment of their imagination. His backhand is a throw, and his flick is also a throw, but when it comes to cutting he is definitely faster than some of the team. Sean is the founder of the woodland fairy club on campus as well and bonfires get him excessively horny. Ladies watch out when you see that smile through the flames, because if ur not faster than the average person or able to change directions quickly, he will catch you, and he will talk to you all night about your life before bringing you to the Wa. Although perhaps not a born leader, this true gentleman has grown into someone who will do just fine at replacing Adlai.

He also displays an amazing curiosity of all of life's little wonders, for example, why is it easier to get sunburnt in the South than the North? However, his amazing curiosity may be prompted by his odd habits, for example, tying his shoes in a symmetrical fashion because it gives him better balance. Puffy enjoys hanging out deep and going deep, much to his girlfriend's delight. She's quite vocal in cheering him on. Using his gym honed upper body, Puffy often skies helpless individuals like Matine.

              Bio: The ongoing story of Anthony Markowitz is one of subtle ruthlessness and terrifying power. Anthony's tenure on Clockwork started innocently enough – at least to untrained eyes. After joining, Anthony quietly accepted a day job as a Clockwork B-Team cutter. He silently went about his work, and did not draw any undue attention to himself. He seemed like an ordinary engineer – we had no cause for suspicion and no forewarning of what was to come.

Before long, however, Anthony made his first move, claiming the job of B-Team Frosh Captain. He seemed to accept his role under upperclass captain Adam Smyles humbly enough, but before long, Smyles started missing practices. He would seem to vanish totally from the earth, only to reappear after all important administrative decisions were made by the remaining captains. We suspected nothing, dismissing it as “Classic Smyles.” However, by the time Georgia rolled around, ClockBlock's other upperclass captain suffered mysterious burns to his legs, rendering him totally unable to play. Decision-making power fell to Anthony. We didn't suspect anything yet, but that was before we knew the truth.

In actuality, Anthony was a sorcerer of terrible power. He began studying magic at a very young age, and his dabbling in the darkest arts quickly grew to an obsession. He would practice his craft in secret for hours every day, preparing for the day when the moment would arise to seize power and dominate the world.

Smyles was Anthony's first true victim. While Smyles was on his way to practice, Anthony would teleport him into an alternate dimension (codename “Philadelphia”), only to pull him back out after Anthony had his way in the captains' meetings. Andy Zhu was his second. We later recovered small pieces of playing cards from deep within Andy's charred legs – a calling card that Anthony would soon become infamous for.

After seizing control of the B-Team, Anthony quickly set his sights on loftier goals. Over the summer, he isolated himself on a mysterious and somewhat shady island of Jew Nersey and consulted with the Hindu god Krishna. Before long, Anthony was deeply immersed an art so dark that is has no speakable name – among Clockwork players, we refer to it with fear as V-J-B.

With this new art, Anthony hypnotized the entirety of Clockwork, distracting them with his newly-jacked thighs as he wrenched the presidency from Jae Lee, who mysteriously broke his foot “playing basketball.” Anthony asserted his complete dominance, ruthlessly accumulating power and extorting money from Clockwork's pockets to fund his ever-growing obsession with sorcery.

Happily, however, Anthony's rule as president of Clockwork has caused him to put his plans for world domination on hold in favor of dominating the world of Ultimate. He is known to make discs disappear completely and reappear in the hands of cutters in the endzone, and he frequently takes control of opposing player's minds to force them to drop the disc. Stephen Wang claims that such magic is the reason he threw three Callahans in a row in practice, but Anthony claims that it's just because Wang sucks.

Anthony is looking forward to killing it this year with his magical hucks, sleight-of-hand defenive measures, and ruthless use of mind control. Today, he dominates ultimate....tomorrow, he'll dominate the world.

              <p>
              Bio: If Clockwork had superlatives, Malcolm's would be: most able to beat the shit out of you.  He has extensive training in Taekwondo (see picture) (no, really) and sock wrestling.  He is fierce and relentless, earning his nickname "ladykiller" his freshman year on ClockBlock skying bitches (both literally and metaphorically).  His sophomore year he elected to return to ClockBlock, choosing not to try out for the A-team under the guise of, "I'm taking six classes and can't commit enough time," when really he wasn't willing to give up those rare opportunities to "deliver the D."  Though often considered to be Sean, the original Georgia alpha rookie was in fact Malcolm.  He skipped the legendary spring break trip his freshman year with the excuse, "I already bought a plane ticket home."  With the extra year to hone his rookie challenge skills, Malcolm descended upon Georgia for the first time as a sophomore, becoming the sock wrestling champion of the world.  His junior year he finally joined the A-team, becoming an integral part of the D-line cutter set.  However, his inner ladykiller desire remained bereft, leaving him no choice but to join the mixed club scene the following summer, where he will no doubt be found poaching deep, anxiously awaiting hucks to women.

              Bio: On the field, Matt Matl is fierce. This Texan, raised mostly on the meat of his favorite prey, the squirrel, has honed his camouflage so well that he can hide from other teams in plain sight. While on D, it is not uncommon for him to simply lie down in the grass and wait for an unsuspecting player to get open near him. When his man approaches, Matl leaps from hiding to get a siiiiick layout D and leaves all those around him stunned. On offense, he cuts with the same ferocity of his agile prey, breaking ankles left and right. Off the field, aside from his squirrel hunting hobby, he is also a kick-ass engineer. He dreams of one day teaming up with other Clockwork engineers to create a weapon so bad-ass it makes the people of the world shake in their collective boots. Until then, he lies in wait.

Adlai Felser is fast, but this guy obviously spends a lot of time in the gym. He is one of the best athletes on Clockwork. Look at Adlai Felser's dump D! Adlai Felser is probably the only player at this tournament who could have gotten that D. Some days, to write poetry, you need a pencil and a paper; others, you just need cleats and a disc.

                Bio:  Ancient Clockwork legend tells of a strongman named Blake Dyer who leg-pressed mountains with ease and drank the blood of his enemies for sustenance. This Blake Dyer is no longer with us.  He has since been replaced by the Rock Doctor (Rocktor), who prides himself on his hacky sack skills and his ability to identify all birds with just a single glance at their genitalia.<br />This reincarnation of Blake is a dedicated vegan, which can often stand in the way of giving impassioned speeches to the team.  His last attempt at inspiration was sidetracked when, after describing how the team must "steal the other team's carrot" Blake began to graphically describe how he would eat the carrot, got a boner, and blacked out. His veganism additionally occupies much of his time, as he is constantly making up cool-sounding words such as "tempeh" and "seitan" to make himself feel better about the shit he eats.
                <br />On occasion, Blake is mistaken for Tyrion Lannister, presumably because of his affinity for wordplay, and definitely having nothing to do with his height. One of his peculiarities is his affinity for the number 7, which is believed to be the age at which he stopped growing. If you're looking for Blake, you can find him in Guyot Hall, where he can be seen staring intently at rocks and making pointed observations such as "this one is pretty grey."

              <p>
              Bio: Julian Hungero-Kelly is youth. Exuberance. Wantonness. Those that knew him best noticed least when he dyed his hair blond, because to them it had always shone golden with his head's vivacious inner radiance. Always moving a great distance per small unit of time, Julian's legs are formidable and many believe their names (H and K) are the source of his nickname.
              <br />The emotional core of Julian's lightning quick exterior persona is a bear trapped in a twink's body. His lithe form and spun gold hair yield assumptions, labels, and twinky teasing that are counter to Julian's inner identity. Because of this, though, Julian is the only member of Clockwork capable of communicating with the Team Girlfriend, a creature at once simple and difficult to understand, but certainly not exclusive with him.
              <br />A lot of people ask what the dash in Hungero-Kelly stands for and, while I think no really man knows, my best guesses are -ology and -headed. Julian came to frisbee as naturally as frisbee came to Julian as naturally as scrubs go to Sunday brunch. If he isn't smoking fools under, he's smoking them deep; or else he's on defense, and is merely biding his time to smoke. Wink.
              <br />In short, any man who does not vote for HK is a fubsy fool.

                <p>
                Bio: Tom Kelly is a Colombian novelist, short-story writer, screenwriter and journalist, known affectionately as TK throughout Latin America. Considered one of the most significant authors and ultimate players of the 20th century, he was awarded the 1972 Neustadt International Prize for Literature and the 1982 Nobel Prize in Literature, and is the earliest remaining living recipient. He pursued a self-directed education and physical fitness regimen that resulted in his leaving law school for a career in journalism and a spot on ClockBlock. From early on, he showed no inhibitions in criticizing Colombian and foreign politics, and in laying out to get the D. In 1958, he married Mercedes Barcha, a Lady Clock alumna; they have two sons, Rodrigo and Gonzalo. While his age is often seen as a weakness by his opponents, his teammates realized early on that with his brittle bones come great wisdom and a keen understanding of the game.

                Bio: On January 30, 1991, Jason Steinberg came into the world. He was always kind of an awkward kid, but quite a brilliant one too. The best decision he ever made in his life was to start playing Ultimate when he was a freshman in high school. He had some pretty sweet throws by the time he came to Princeton, and he quietly introduced himself to Clockwork as Jason. Jason Yun '10 was clearly intimidated by this new, better-looking Jason, and he quickly thought of a nickname to preserve his own identity. And just like that, Nooj was born.
                <br />
                Don't be fooled by Nooj's shy demeanor; he is a fearless leader of Clockwork and plays unrelenting defense. You might see him just Noojing around campus at times, with no destination in mind, but on the field, his cuts are sharp and his hucks are deadly. Nooj is also well known for his popularity with the ladies, especially when he has his trusty wingman, Eduardo.
                Recently, Nooj has been used colloquially as a verb, an adjective, and basically any other part of speech you can think of. So I will leave you with one last thought: Nooj noojes noojingly, noojing noojes nooj. Nooj.</p>

                Bio: Krishna Kulkarni was born in the wild woods of Houston, Texas, not by the vagina of a woman as one would typically expect, but instead he passed into life through the vaginal passages of a mother wolf. Raised by wolves through his childhood, it was not until he was introduced into society in his freshman year at Princeton that he discovered at nights he would transform into a beast, half man, half wolf, and rampage around mauling skanks. He visited an old wiseman to learn how he could possibly lift his curse, and the wiseman told him he was cursed to roam the nights as a beast until he had slept with a hundred virgin freshmen. Krishna joined the ultimate team as a way to meet such freshman girls, and discovered his wolfish powers lent themselves to the sport, and ever since that day, he has been skying bitches and preying on freshman girls, working diligently until the day that he can finally lift his curse.

                <h3>Alex Lee</h3>
                <p>AKA Jailbait</p>
                <p>5'10''</p>
                <p>Class of 2015</p>
                <p>Hometown: Rochester, NY</p>
                <p>Club teams: Moby Disc</p>
                <p>
                Bio: Alex.  It's one of the most common first names in the English language.  Lee.  A ubiquitous surname in English, Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese.  When you're stuck with a name like Alex Lee, it's a wonder your parents even remember you exist.  Poor Alex Lee knew growing up he would have to do something extraordinary to achieve his secret goal of eventually being known as Alexander the Greatest.</p>
                <p>
                On his journey to the present day, young Alex Lee made a number of efforts to distinguish himself and get people to acknowledge his presence.  He attended a high school called the Canandaigua Academy, which sounded good until he realized it was actually a school for Canadians with impaired spelling abilities.  Impressively, he did manage to date a white girl for a time before his parents clamped down and insisted he protect his family's honor.  Left with no choice, Alex Lee buckled down and studied until he was accepted to Princeton University, taking a giant first step towards finally becoming a somebody.
                </p><p>
                He then made the fatal mistake to major in ORFE, and sank back into obscurity as just another engineer who was too smart for econ but still wanted to make money.  He desperately cut his hair Skrillex style in Georgia last year, but it was too late.  Mere inches from the edge of the void of total namelessness, Alex Lee was on his way down when the devil appeared before him and halted his fall.  He gave Alex Lee a choice: Sink into nothingness, or sell his soul to Satan and become a slave to pitchfork.com.  Alex looked out into the inky darkness, thought for a second, and opened up his web browser.
                </p><p>
                Nowadays, Alex enjoys listening to Taylor Swift and other singers nobody else has heard of.  He also plays ultimate for Clockwork in hopes that he will make a name for himself as a dark horse handler and free himself from his pact with the Devil.

                <p>
                Bio: Yuan Chen was an American professional basketball player with the New York Knicks of the National Basketball Association (NBA). After receiving no athletic scholarship offers out of high school and being undrafted out of college, the Harvard University graduate reached a deal later that year with his hometown Golden State Warriors. In February 2012, he unexpectedly led a winning streak by New York, which generated a global following known as Chensanity.
                <br />
                Eventually, Yuan realized how lousy a team the Knicks were and retired from professional basketball. After realizing his economics degree from a second-rate school like Harvard was worthless, Yuan decided to go back to college and came to Princeton. While here, He decided to major in a real subject like Electrical Engineering motivated by the fact that it "triumphs over MAE" and has recently expressed his love for the subject matter by devoting hours of his time to car lab instead of uploading the pictures from developmental regionals.
                <br />
                Since joining Clockwork, Yuan has been known for his "nice cutting technique" as well as his fast break offense.

              <p>Club teams: Chicago Natives</p>
              <p>
              Bio: Brohao earned his improved nickname by winning the man-versus-keg challenge at his rookie appearance in Georgia (legit) before leading the rookies in an inspiring beach lacrosse victory over Yale (sucks). Since then he has developed tremendously as a defender, as a handler, as a bro, and most of all as a ladies man.  Brohau is well-known for never missing a Clock-Lady Clock mixer and his success on the dance floor, out-competing even Adlai.  Brohau is in the running for the squirrelly Asian handler role left vacant since Adam Hugh, and has even been observed watching Princeton Sciuridae for "tips". His bromance with Patrick has gone a long way to improving relations with the B team, and has cemented the best Clockwork pairing since Pinky and the Brain. His time as president saw the reform of the Clockwork government, with the introduction of a vice president, secretaries, and commander of the praetorian guard.  When not at practice, Brohau spends all his time in Icahn running "experiments" in lab.  He claims his work is actually pretty sciency, but we all think he's just creating a perfect Frisbee player with a combination of his and Michael Jordan's genes.

              <p>
              Bio: Who is Jarred Mickalicka? Not me. That's for sure. Jarred is an enigmatic figure in Clockwork lore whose essence resists being pinned down. Clad in full Clock uniform, Jarred  is Clockwork's most perfectly beautiful specimen --- with his chiseled cheek bones and Adonic body, he is the team's exemplary Aryan (sorry Neal). But catch him around campus and he's in full-on hipster Clarke Kent mode. Is he Superman (he's certainly not a bird or a plane)? Maybe. Or maybe you think he's more Mandarin because Mandarin is Asian. This would be a misconception – Jarred is not actually Asian. He is more like Iron Man....because he slays Asians.  But I think he's more of a Rorschach. Not especially chatty on the field, but if you mess with him or just try to play offense, he will fuck you up – and he's got the TMFs to prove it. But if you do decide to play against him, be warned: he can't be predicted – he's got a devastating no-look flick. As a good athlete who throws his body around for D's and has made huge progress as an offensive weapon in short period time, Jarred is going to be a pillar of D-line in years to come. So who is Jarred Mihalik? A mystery sure, but maybe also Clockwork's newest hero.

                Bio: Matt Rogers is the best player on the Junior Worlds team, even though he is too old to play.  He is the classic story of the man who couldn't last long enough.  By 3 on 3 season, his knees were on their way out, and by regionals he could only make it through the first few games.  He doesn't always play ultimate, but when he does, he prefers to play really well.  In all seriousness, Matt Rogers is really really sick.  We have decided to quarantine him to a large, and (most importantly) padded bubble so that he can not injure himself until we are ready to unleash him upon the world.

                Bio: I'm Ross Smith, a bankruptcy lawyer in Sandusky, Ohio. I have over thirty years of experience helping people who need a way to get out of debt and back on track. If you need a chance to put your debt behind you and get legal protection from your creditors, I can help. Many people who file bankruptcy do so for one of these four reasons. Do any of these common problems apply to your situation?
                <br />
                Medical bills. Sixty-two percent of consumer bankruptcies are caused by medical bills. Who knew? Expensive doctors plus crappy insurance cause bankruptcy.
                Bill collectors. Gee, if you have 20 collectors calling you 10 times a day, at work, at home and at the neighbors, you'll finally file bankruptcy just to get some peace. Do you think that bill collectors know that they are one of the primary causes of bankruptcy?
                <br />
                Credit card companies. Golly, the bank just jacked your interest rate to 29.99%and lowered your credit limit! Then they slapped you with an over limit fee of $39.00 a month. In the end, the bank is surprised that you can't make the increased minimum payment. And the bank is shocked — shocked! — to get your Notice of Bankruptcy. My condolences to the banks.
                Predator Mortgages. Holy cats! Your home has a $150,000.00 mortgage, but it's only worth $115,000.00. Worse, the interest rate is 9.5% or even higher. We wonder why you can't make that payment… but not much. Time to file a bankruptcy.

                <p>Class of 2014</p>
                <p>Hometown: Baton Rouge, LA</p>
                <p>Club teams: Gunswick</p>
                <p>
                Bio: A highly sought after recruit from the swamps of Louisiana, Stephen Wang
                had ultimate scouts drooling over his potential. Affectionately known as "Every
                Coach's Dream", Wang had a cannon of an arm, pogo sticks for legs, and the entire
                country in anticipation about his impending college decision. On a nationally
                televised special Wang announced that he would be taking his talents to New Jersey
                to unite with hometown hero Andrew Bergman and fellow prized recruit Neal
                Donnelly, netting himself an army of haters at home and the Boys and Girls Club of
                Louisiana about $2 million.<br />
                However the "Wang Dynasty" didn't begin as successfully as expected as
                Wang struggled to carry his teammates and the country's expectations. Additionally,
                disaster struck for Stephen both personally and professionally. A severe case of eye
                herpes plagued him on the morning of a tournament and severely limited his ability,
                inevitably leading to a disaster now known as the "Massacre in Mercer" where
                Clockwork almost managed to lose to its own B-team. However, the worst was yet to
                come, as Clockwork Ultimate was about to experience the biggest sports scandal
                this side of Tiger Woods. First a few isolated rumors from TMZ began filtering in
                and then the bombshell came from a most curious of sources. A mysterious insider,
                who only identified herself as VQu to protect her identity, informed ESPN via Skype
                that the rumors were true: Wang indeed had a tiny penis.<br />
                Wang was devastated. After a brief layoff from college ultimate for personal
                reasons, Wang rededicated himself to the game he loves. From hitting the weight
                room at the crack of dawn to sprinting to the farthest poles he could find, Wang was
                determined to compensate for his now famous deficiency with tremendous on-field
                success, and the results were staggering. His sheer determination almost carried
                Clockwork to a surprise bid to Nationals in his sophomore season.<br />
                It's interesting to think about how Ultivillage historians centuries from now
                will classify Stephen's time at Princeton. The next two years will ultimately
                determine whether the Wang Dynasty was a rousing success in the face of adversity
                or an experiment derailed by scandal. Despite all this uncertainty, however, one
                thing is for sure: nobody will be working harder than Wang.

Make no mistake, once one finally meets Dean Makino, one does not forget Dean Makino. When he's not shitting on the defense with his relentless cutting, he's most likely whispering obscenties into his mark's ear (although it is rumored that Dean, indeed, has a voice "which makes wolverines purr"). Dean has never had second thoughts about any in-game decision, since he always knows the wrong thing to do. Nevertheless, he has been a vital part of ClockBlock, and we hope to see great things down the road from Dean. To quote the words of a much wiser man: "Never have I ever seen an individual play so retarded and yet play so well."
